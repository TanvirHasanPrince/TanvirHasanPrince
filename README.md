## 👋 Hello, I'm Tanvir Hasan Prince

### 🎓 About Me
I am a Master's student in Economics with a strong interest in economic theory, quantitative analysis, and applied research. My academic focus lies in understanding how economic models explain real world phenomena, particularly in areas such as economic growth, development, macroeconomic dynamics, and policy analysis.

I use this GitHub profile to document my academic journey, share notes, models, problem sets, and projects related to economics. Over time, this space will reflect my work with economic theory, mathematical economics, and data driven analysis.

My goal is to develop strong analytical and research skills that bridge theory and real world economic problems.
